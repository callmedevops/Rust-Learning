Imports: Import the necessary libraries and types at the beginning of the file.

rust
Copy code
use reqwest::Error;
use select::document::Document;
use select::predicate::{Class, Name, Predicate};
Async main function: Use the tokio::main attribute macro to define an async main function. This macro allows you to use await for asynchronous operations within the main function.

rust
Copy code
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
Target URL: Set the target URL to "https://news.ycombinator.com/".

rust
Copy code
let url = "https://news.ycombinator.com/";
HTTP GET request: Make an HTTP GET request using reqwest::get(url).await?. This sends a request to the target URL and retrieves the response asynchronously. The ? operator is used to handle errors; if an error occurs, the function will return early with the error.

rust
Copy code
let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
Retrieve HTML content: Get the HTML content of the response using response.text().await?. This extracts the response body as a string.

rust
Copy code
let html = response.text().await?;
Parse HTML: Parse the HTML content into a Document object using Document::from(html.as_str()). This creates a structured representation of the HTML document that you can navigate and query.

rust
Copy code
let document = Document::from(html.as_str());
Find and iterate elements: Iterate through the elements in the document that match the specified criteria. In this case, we're looking for elements with the "titleline" class that have a child "a" element. The find method accepts a Predicate object, which is constructed using the Class and Name predicates, combined using the child method.

rust
Copy code
for title in document.find(Class("titleline").child(Name("a"))) {
Print element text: For each matched element, print its text content using the text method.

rust
Copy code
    println!("{}", title.text());
}
Indicate success: Return Ok(()) to indicate successful execution. If an error occurs at any point during the execution, the function will return early with an Error.

rust
Copy code
Ok(())
}
This web scraper extracts the titles of the latest news articles from the "https://news.ycombinator.com/" website. It sends an HTTP request, retrieves the response, parses the HTML content, finds the relevant elements based on the specified criteria, and prints their text content.
